//One 

We have defined a function, filteredArray, which takes arr, a nested array, and elem as arguments, 
and returns a new array. elem represents an element that may or may not be present on one or more of
the arrays nested within arr. Modify the function, using a for loop, to return a filtered version of 
the passed array such that any array nested within arr containing elem has been removed.

//Two
We have defined a variable, myNestedArray, set equal to an array. Modify myNestedArray, using any 
combination of strings, numbers, and booleans for data elements, so that it has exactly five levels 
of depth (remember, the outer-most array is level 1). Somewhere on the third level, include the string
'deep', on the fourth level, include the string 'deeper', and on the fifth level, include the string 'deepest'.
